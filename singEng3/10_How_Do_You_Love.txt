How do you love?

Maybe soon, maybe later
You say that hate cannot convert no hater
Maybe soon, or even tomorrow
This heart of mine is free from sorrow

For now I'll go, one day I'll stay
I can hear you pray
Maybe soon, maybe later
I'm back again
But now I wonder, but now I wonder, I say

Hey! How do you do it
How do you love you look at someone who knew it
I say hey! How do you do it
How do you love?
(Hey!) How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?

How do you love?

Maybe soon, maybe never
You say the truth is not a question of leaver
Maybe soon, or even sooner
There's doing it in the sail of the skoner

For now I go, one day I'll stay
Come and meet me at the bay
Maybe June, or maybe December, I'll love again
But now I wonder, now I wonder, I say

Hey! How do you do it?
How do you love you look at someone who knew it
I say hey! How do you do it
How do you love?
(Hey!) How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! 

One hundred heartbreaks a countin'
A single kiss you save me from drowning
That's how you love
That's how you love

Hey! How do you do it?
How do you love, you look at someone who blew it
I say hey! How do you do it?
How do you love?

Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?

Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?

Hey! How do you love?
Hey! How do you love?
How do you love?
