Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh-whoa
Caught up (caught up)
Face down (face down)
So long (so long)
You win again
Check mate (check mate)
I'm out (I'm out)
We're done (we're done)
You win again

Running, running, running a race
It wasn't like this way back in the day, hey, hey
When I wake up in the morning
I got the whole world in my hand
A little faith would help me
Break away from all the things you said

Running, running, running a race
It wasn't like this way back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
All my mind
Light up my soul I need a little faith

Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh-whoa

Slow down (slow down)
Off track (off track)
You turn (you turn)
No more games
Get up (get up)
Downtown (downtown)
Touché (touché)
No more games

Running, running, running a race
It wasn't like this way back in the day, hey, hey
When I wake up in the morning
I got the whole world in my hand
A little faith would help me
Break away from all the things you said

Running, running, running a race
It wasn't like this way back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
All my mind
Light up my soul I need a little faith

Who come and set me free?
Why's it so hard to be?
I just wanna let go and breathe
Is there another way?
Or is it the price we pay?
Just wanna let go and breathe
Let go and breathe

When I wake up in the morning
I got the whole world in my hand
A little faith would help me
Break away from all the things you said

Running, running, running a race
It wasn't like this way back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
All my mind
Light up my soul I need a little faith

Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh-whoa

Light up my soul I need a little faith
