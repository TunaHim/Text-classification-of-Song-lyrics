Most of my days I've spend life on the road
Took backroad highways to meet the simple folk
Nights ran together in a haze of drink and smoke
So I left with the rising sun all alone
Go go

Shake away, shake away the old chains in my life
Got a new, got a new love and open eyes
Break away, break away the old ways and live high
Got a new course for the light

Made it out west through the deserts and the snow
How you found me I reckon someday I'll know
You picked me up from the depth I couldnâ€™t cope
And you showed me a life of love, trust and hope
Go go

Shake away, shake away the old chains in my life
Got a new, got a new love and open eyes
Break away, break away the old ways and live high
Got a new course for the light
Got a new course for the light
Got a new course for the light
