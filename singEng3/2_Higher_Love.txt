Oh my love, my love, my love
What have I done?
Where have I gone wrong again?
I hear you talk, you talk, you talk
Lay it all down
But I'm not listening
In your eyes I learn to see
Oh the mirror hiding me
In the darkness I can dream

If you give me high
High, higher love
Tell me there's no other one
One, one above

Oh my love, my love, my love
We're running out of time
We're about to lose the light of day
I hear you knock, you knock, you knock
But I'm not home
I'm too far gone
In your eyes I learn to see
Oh the mirror hiding me
In the darkness I can dream

If you give me high
High, higher love
Tell me there's no other one
One, one above
High, high, higher love
Tell me there's no other one
One, one above

If you give me high
High, higher love
Tell me there's no other one, one, one above
If you give me high
High, higher love
Tell me there's no other one
One, one above

Oh my love, my love, my love
What have I done
Where have I gone wrong again
I'm back in your arms
