I've been thinking about the dark soul of Rock'n'Roll
About the loss, about the heavy toll
Voices of angels are suddenly just gone
Life can be short, but melody lives on

I sing a requiem and a Halle- Hallelujah
Requiem and a Halle- I sing for you
Requiem and a Halle- Hallelujah
To light up the dark

I heard the news about how she was found
About a man who pulled the trigger and fell to the ground
Another one walked into the river 
And got swept along
Life can be short, but melody lives on

I sing a requiem and a Halle- Hallelujah
Requiem and a Halle- I sing for you
Requiem and a Halle- Hallelujah

Oh, until they are touching the sky
Higher they fly
Touching you, take them to paradise

Requiem and a Halle- Hallelujah
Requiem and a Halle- I sing for you
Requiem and a Halle- Hallelujah

Oh, until they are touching the sky
Higher they fly
Touching you, take them to paradise
