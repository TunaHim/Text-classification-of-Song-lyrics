I've been sleepin'
And I've been fadin' away
Needed healin'
Was caught up trying to kill the pain, yeah yeah

I heard a voice inside sayin'
"It's time to
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
Yeah, I want you
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)"

Got a feelin'
Someone's gonna take me home
I'm believin'
Am I gonna find you?
Got a feelin'
Someone's gonna take me home
Lazarus rising
I'm coming alive, yeah

(Wake him up, wake him up)
(Wake him up, wake him up)

No more weepin'
You kiss my tears all the way
I hear you breathin'
Lightning crashed as you came
Yes, you came

Still hear the voice inside sayin'
"It's time to
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
Yeah, I want you

(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)"

Got a feelin'
Creepin' up in my bones
I'm believin'
No one's gonna buy me
Got a feelin'
Creepin' up in my bones
Lazarus rising
I'm coming alive, yeah

Only you can save me
Only you embrace me
Only you can save me
Save me

Got a feelin'
Someone's gonna take me home
I'm believin'
Am I gonna find you?
Got a feelin'
Someone's gonna take me home
Lazarus rising
I'm coming alive, yeah

Got a feelin'
Creepin' up in my bones
I'm believin'
No one's gonna buy me
Got a feelin'
Creepin' up in my bones
Lazarus rising
I'm coming alive, yeah
