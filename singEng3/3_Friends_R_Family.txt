You're closer than a brother to me
No tit for tat, no rivalry
Together we've grown, remember when we
Were seven years old running wild and free
Traveling time, your battles are mine
We laugh so hard 'till we cry and our heads are
Spinning, yup, spinning, yup, spinning, yup
Hey my friend you understand
You like me just the way I am
You can read my life like an open book
And my secrets will be safe with you
No little lies, Chinese whispers
Keeping score, no losing and
No winning, yup, no winning, yup, no winning, yup
Where would I be without you

'Cause friends are the family 
That you choose and I thank god that you chose me
I'm thankful I chose you
Oh oh oh
Friends are your family
And any time my heart is black and blue
You'll be there for me
Like I'll be there for you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!

Remember when we turned sixteen
And got in the clubs with fake iD
You filmed the scene when I cut my hair
Everybody went mad, but we didn't care
Through thick 'n' thin, we're stickin' in
Two of a kind, with one voice
We are singing, yup, we're singing, yup, we're singing, yup
Like I'll be there for you ooh ooh

'Cause friends are the family 
That you choose and I thank god that you chose me
I'm thankful I chose you
Oh oh oh
Friends are your family
And any time my heart is black and blue
You'll be there for me
Oh oh oh

Friends are the family 
That you choose and I thank god that you chose me
I'm thankful I chose you
Oh oh oh
Friends are your family
And any time my heart is black and blue
You'll be there for me
Like I'll be there for you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Remember when we turned sixteen
And got in the clubs with fake iD
You're closer than a brother to me
