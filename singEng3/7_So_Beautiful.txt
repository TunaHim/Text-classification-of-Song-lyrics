The ruby stone reflects your heart
Oh, gentle lover in the art
See in the dark
A little diamond shining star

You're so beautiful
Oh so luminous
You're unbreakable
Oh so beautiful

I saw you then, I see you now
Oh, bitter truth in your eyes
You clear the chaos
Oh day of days, night of nights

You're so beautiful
Oh so luminous
You're unbreakable
Oh so beautiful

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful

You're so beautiful
Oh so luminous
