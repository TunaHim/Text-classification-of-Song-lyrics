We're fighting still fighting
Repeating history
All right then it's all right if
You don't think like me
But your problem is my problem
Don't you feel the ricochet?
If we turn against each other
That's not a game we wanna play

Who am I who are you who are we?
All human beings
Who am I who are you who are we?
What do you see?

If you you see my iD, iD, iD
I'm more than a passport I'm unique
See my iD, iD, iD
You can be you and I'll be me
Let me see your iD, iD, iD
I see it in your fingerprint you're unique
I see your iD, iD, iD
You can be you and I'll be me

I'm hopin' you're open to understand me
You know I'm outspoken no hidden plan B
It's not cool to know that
Your house could be your grave
Spread love amongst each other
And we can watch the children play

Who am I who are you who are we?
All human beings
Who am I who are you who are we?
What do you see?

If you you see my iD, iD, iD
I'm more than a passport I'm unique
See my iD, iD, iD
You can be you and I'll be me
Let me see your iD, iD, iD
I see it in your fingerprint you're unique
I see your iD, iD, iD
You can be you and I'll be me

iD, iD, iD you can be you and I'll be me
iD, iD, iD you can be you and I'll be me
iD, iD, iD you can be you and I'll be me
iD, iD, iD you can be you and I'll be me

Stop your fighting, give you brother some help and
Do you believe in something higher than yourself and
You full of love that mean you know you're full of wealth
Got to lace up your shoes buckle your belt, weh mi guh suh then
You see mi iD then you know that we are one and
You see my iD doesn't matter where we're from man
So by the end of day a man is just a man
My identification, weh mi guh suh then

Who am I who are you who are we?
All human beings
Who am I who are you who are we?
What do you see?

If you you see my iD iD iD
