I got a hold and I won't let go of it again
No I'm not looking back
We had our reasons for losing touch
But I know we used to like to complain

Come down to the rocks where we would bathe in the river's arms
Come down, we can talk, we can talk like

When we were young
When we were young
There was a light upon everyone
When we were young
When we were young
We were alive in the summer sun

Tonight
Take me to a golden age
Tonight

I got a feeling inside, it's never going away
The future is coming back
I'm in a movie where everybody is frozen in time
And getting ready to dance

Come down to the rocks where we would blaze in the summer sun
Come down, we can talk, we can talk like

When we were young
When we were young
There was a light upon everyone
When we were young
When we were young
We were alive in the summer sun

Tonight
Take me to a golden age
Tonight

(Oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)
Like when we were young
(Oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)
Waiting for a golden age
(Oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)
Like when we were young
(Oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)
We should talk like

When we were young
When we were young
There was a light upon everyone
When we were young
When we were young
We were alive in the summer sun

Tonight
Take me to a golden age
Tonight

(Oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)
Like when we were young
(Oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)
I can feel a golden age
(Tonight) (oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)
Like when we were young
(Tonight) (oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh)

I can feel a golden age
